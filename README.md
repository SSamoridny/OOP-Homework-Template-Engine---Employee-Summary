Team Builder

YouTuve demo: https://youtu.be/ReG3YcHeaRs

Technologies Used:
HTML / CSS
JavaScript
Node.js

In this Node app we build an employee page based on information passed through our Node terminal. By taking this raw data and pushing it through our JS and rendering it through HTML we are able to make a complete visual page where our user can see their newly built team.
